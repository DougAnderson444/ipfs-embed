- make PortReuse configurable (and recommend to turn it off)
- update to ipfs-sqlite-block-store 0.10 and thereby rusqlite 0.26
- rewrite address book logic to validate addresses and retain only confirmed ones:

  - every outgoing dial failure removes unconfirmed addresses (or confirmed, if PeerId changed)
  - all discovered addresses from MDNS and Kademlia are validated by dialling
  - all incoming connectionsâ€™ remote addresses are translated to likely listen addresses using IdentifyInfo
